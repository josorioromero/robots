# Simple app robots

Steps
- Clone the current repo
- `cd src/api/`
- install dependencies `yarn or npm install`
- run `node server.js` the server will start in port 5000
- `cd ../src`
- install dependencies `yarn or npm install`
- run `yarn dev` so the page will render by default in the port 5173, this is the default port for Vite.js
- test should run with `yarn test` however there's a missing configuration and I was running out of time =)
